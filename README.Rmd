### A package for performing fidelity checks on messy dataframes.

Inspectr consists of functions adapted from a quality control script I developed
for performing data checks on large datasets from an educational assessment, 
then generalized for more generic application.

The inspectr package contains two classes of functions: column checks and basic 
fidelity checks. Column check functions allow the user to check data for 
fidelity without having to master apply functions, and basic fidelity check 
functions can be used to facilitate some common checks. The user can also define
their own checks to use with the column check functions, making the package 
generalizable to unique data requirements.

#### Getting started
The data-checks vignette included with this package provides an overview of how
to use the column check functions and illustrates the included basic fidelity
check functions: `vignette("introduction", package = "dplyr")`
