inspectr
========

A package for performing fidelity checks on messy dataframes.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Functions adapted from a quality control script I developed for performing data checks on large datasets from an educational assessment, then generalized for more generic application.

The inspectr package contains two classes of functions: column checks and basic fidelity checks.
